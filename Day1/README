Alright!  Day 1!  Here's your task:  Build out Libs/ManageAllGrafts.py.

Please use the existing interfaces defined in the Libs directory - those in ManageAllGrafts.py and ManageSysgraft.py.

You'll fill actual code into ManageSysgraft tomorrow, so make sure you use the interface that's defined already.  ManageSysgraft's functions even return things useful for your testing.

Feel free to build extra classes or modules if you want!  For instance, I added a class whose objects represent command/response pairs.  It's possible to use a tuple for that, too, of course, and you can even have a tuple with timestamps for command/response in there, but it gets a little messy.
